# Reference Material

This project uses prebuilt container images for each service in the Matrix stack. The playbook installs and runs these containers with Podman in rootless mode. Configuration is intentionally minimal so that the deployment can be tested quickly.

Refer to the [DeployMatrix README](../README.md) for an overview of the project and usage instructions.
